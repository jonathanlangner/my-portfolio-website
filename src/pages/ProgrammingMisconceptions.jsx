                            <hr></hr>
                                <p className="h3 mt-3">Misconception 1: Programming is impossible for you to learn.</p>
                                <p className="mt-4"> <i>Anyone can learn programming provided you have the following:</i> </p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li className="mt-3">üï∞ A simple understanding of Arithmetic, along with a little Algebra.</li>
                                    <li className="mt-3">üß† A desire to consistently learn each day.</li>
                                    <li className="mt-3">üé® An aspiration to continuously work with unique and challenging puzzles or problems which build your creativity and problem-solving skills.</li> 
                                </ul>
                            <hr></hr>    
                                <p className="h3 mt-3">Misconception 2: Programming can be learned in a day.</p>
                                <ul>
                                <li className="mt-4">‚òÄ There is a reason I emphasize the concept of daily learning. Programming is a skillset which teaches you a novel way to be creative. It is broad enough and challenging enough that dedicated daily effort makes the biggest impact over time. </li>
                                    <li className="mt-3">Expect it to take 120 days of consistent effort and study for 30 minutes each day for you to be relatively creative with the core concepts of programming.</li>
                                    <li className="mt-3">120 days is an estimate, and your starting point may allow you to progress more or less quickly. 
                                        The key is: Strive for daily learning, challenge yourself, and track your learning progress.</li> 
                                </ul>
                            <hr></hr>    
                            <p className="h3 mt-3">Misconception 3: Programming can only be used for designing applications.</p>
                            <p className="mt-4"><i>Programming is useful for much more than writing applications. <br></br> A few other examples include:</i> </p>
                            <ul>
                                <li className="mt-3">üíØ Evaluating Data. This is often done for Scientific Research, Business Analysis, and Learning.</li>
                                <li className="mt-3">üå≥ Solving Real World Problems. Programming can be used to simulate and solve different real-world problems or ideas. </li>
                                <li className="mt-3">ü™¢ Programming is used in combination with machines to do automation. (Computer Numeric Control Machines, and Manufacturing Robotics)</li> 
                                <li className="mt-3">üè° Enhancing your Home. Programming allows you to make your home smarter by adding sensors that you can control to regulate lights and temperature.</li> 
                            </ul>
                            <hr></hr>
                            <p className="h3 mt-3">Misconception 4: Programming is something you can only learn through college.</p>
                            <p className="mt-4"><i>There are many ways to delve into programming besides college. <br></br>Here are just a few of the many options out there today:</i> </p>

                            <p className="h3 mt-3">Misconception 6: You need to learn just one programming language. </p>
