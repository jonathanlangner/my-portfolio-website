                               <h3>Throughout your programming journey, you have probably heard many things you need.
                                    Some examples include more languages, fewer languages, and the most popular or latest ideas or technologies.  
                               </h3>

                                <ul>
                                    <li className="mt-3">You may not need to learn more languages. Instead, You need a skill set that is transferable and relevant to programming or design projects within the industry.
                                    </li>
                                    <li className="mt-3">You require a fundamental building block to help solve real-world problems. 
                                    </li>
                                    <li className="mt-3"> This is where Data Structures and Algorithms come in. 
                                    </li>
                                </ul>

                                <h3 className="mt-3">ðŸ—‚ Why Data Structures?</h3>
                                <ul>
                                    <li className="mt-3">Data Structures are a crucial building block for managing data in applications. </li>
                                    <li className="mt-3"> Data Types Include: Linked Lists, Binary Trees, Graphs, and Stacks to name a few. </li>
                                    <li className="mt-3"> Learning and knowing Data Structures by heart is necessary because without those: applications, designs, and programs cannot be created or will not function well enough to compete in the real world.  </li>
                                    <li className="mt-3"> To become an effective developer: you require Data Structures to get your skills to the next level. <br></br>For the basics of starting Data Structures see:  <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/data-structures/?ref=shm">GeeksForGeeks Data Structures</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/learning/programming-foundations-data-structures-2/understand-data-structures?autoplay=true">Linkedin Learning Data Structures </a></li>

                                <h3 className="mt-3">ðŸ“Š Why Algorithms?</h3>
                                <ul>
                                    <li className="mt-3">Algorithms teach you to think as a programmer, and they add real metrics, reason, and depth to your overall designs and projects.
                                    Additionally: Algorithms help you not need to "reinvent the wheel" or to solve problems that have already been solved.
                                    </li>
                                    <li> A Few Categories of Algorithms Include: Searching, Sorting, Divide and Conquer, Recursive, Backtracking, and Hashing.</li>
                                    <li className="mt-3">As you learn Algorithms, you will also learn to measure the time cost of more complex processes in programming, and you will be able to evaluate flaws in your reasoning and designs.</li>
                                    <li className="mt-3">You will need to learn Data Structures before you start learning Algorithms. The reason is: Most algorithms involve understanding and using Data Structures.</li>
